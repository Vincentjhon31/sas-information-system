# Documentation Consistency Updates

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Updated By:** Development Team  
**Change Type:** Documentation Standardization

---

## Summary

This document tracks consistency improvements made across all project documentation files to ensure uniform terminology, naming conventions, and cross-references.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Project Name Standardization

**Change:** Unified project name across all documents

**Before:** 
- Mixed use of "SAS Information System" and "MinSU Bongabong Information System"

**After:**
- **Standard Name:** "MinSU Bongabong Information System"
- **Full Name:** "Mindoro State University - Bongabong Campus Information System"

**Files Updated:**
- ✓ PRD.md
- ✓ USER_STORIES.md
- ✓ DATA_MODELS.md
- ✓ API_SPECIFICATIONS.md
- ✓ NFR.md
- ✓ ARCHITECTURE.md (already correct)

**Rationale:** The system encompasses more than just Student Affairs Services (SAS) - it includes Registrar and USG modules. The name should reflect the institutional scope.

---

### 2. ✅ Campus Name Formatting Standardization

**Change:** Consistent campus name format

**Standard Format:** "Mindoro State University - Bongabong Campus"
- Uses hyphen (not en-dash)
- Includes "Campus" suffix
- Proper title casing

**Files Updated:** All documentation files now use consistent formatting

---

### 3. ✅ Placeholder Domain Disclaimer

**Change:** Added disclaimer about placeholder domains

**Added To:**
- API_SPECIFICATIONS.md
- NFR.md

**Disclaimer Text:**
> **Note:** All domain names (minsubongabong.edu.ph, api.minsubongabong.edu.ph) used in this document are placeholders for demonstration purposes. Actual production domains will be provided by Mindoro State University IT Services.

**Rationale:** Clarifies that URLs are examples and actual domains will be provided by university IT.

---

### 4. ✅ Technology Stack Reference

**Change:** Added cross-reference to ARCHITECTURE.md in PRD.md

**Addition:** New "Technology Stack Overview" section in PRD.md that:
- Lists primary technologies (Laravel 12, React 19, etc.)
- References ARCHITECTURE.md for complete specifications
- Provides direct link to technical documentation

**Rationale:** Avoids duplication while ensuring readers know where to find detailed tech stack information.

---

### 5. ✅ Database Naming Conventions

**Change:** Added explicit database naming convention section in DATA_MODELS.md

**New Section Includes:**
- Database name: `minsu_bongabong`
- Character set and collation specifications
- Table prefixing strategy explanation:
  - No prefix: Shared tables (users, roles, permissions)
  - `sas_` prefix: Student Affairs module
  - `registrar_` prefix: Registrar module
  - `usg_` prefix: USG portal module
- Benefits of the table prefixing approach

**Rationale:** Explicitly documents naming strategy to prevent confusion about schema organization.

---

### 6. ✅ Directory Structure Standardization (October 4, 2025)

**Change:** Standardized directory structure across all documentation

**Actions Taken:**
1. **Created DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md**: New comprehensive reference document serving as single source of truth for project file organization
2. **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md**: Expanded directory structure section to include:
   - All subdirectories (Events/, Listeners/, Jobs/, Mail/, Notifications/, Services/, Policies/)
   - Complete resources/js/ structure with all component folders
   - Database/ structure with factories/ and seeders/ organized by module
   - Tests/ structure with Feature/ and Unit/ organized by module
3. **Cross-References Added**: Documentation now references DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md for file organization details

**New DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md Includes:**
- Complete project tree from root to leaf nodes
- Module-specific file organization (SAS, Registrar, USG)
- Naming conventions for backend (PHP/Laravel) and frontend (TypeScript/React)
- Laravel 12 specific notes (no Kernel classes, auto-registration)
- Testing organization guidelines
- Related documentation references

**Files Updated:**
- ✓ ARCHITECTURE.md (expanded directory structure)
- ✓ DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md (new comprehensive reference)
- ✓ CHANGELOG_DOCUMENTATION.md (this file)

**Rationale:** Having a single, comprehensive directory structure document prevents inconsistencies and provides developers with a clear roadmap of where files should be created. The structure follows Laravel 12 conventions and clearly separates the three modules while maintaining shared code in appropriate locations.

## Cross-Document Consistency Verification

### ✅ Verified Consistent Elements:

1. **Date**: All documents show "October 4, 2025"
2. **Version**: All documents show "Version 1.0"
3. **Technology Stack**: 
   - Laravel 12
   - React 19
   - Inertia.js v2
   - PHP 8.2+
   - MySQL 8.0+
   - TypeScript 5.x
   - Tailwind CSS 4.x
   - Vite 6.x
4. **Architecture**: Single-campus deployment, modular monolith
5. **Three-Module Structure**: SAS, Registrar, USG

## Remaining Recommendations

### For Future Updates:

1. **Feature Coverage**: Ensure all P0/P1 features from PRD.md have corresponding:
   - User stories in USER_STORIES.md
   - API endpoints in API_SPECIFICATIONS.md
   - Data models in DATA_MODELS.md

2. **Version Control**: When updating any document:
   - Update version number consistently across all docs
   - Update date consistently across all docs
   - Document changes in this CHANGELOG

3. **Cross-References**: When adding new features:
   - Reference related sections in other documents
   - Keep terminology consistent across all docs
