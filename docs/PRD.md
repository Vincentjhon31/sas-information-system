# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## MinSU Bongabong Information System

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Full Name:** Mindoro State University - Bongabong Campus Information System  
**Product Owner:** University Administration  
**Technical Lead:** Development Team

---

## Executive Summary

The MinSU Bongabong Information System is an integrated web platform designed to digitalize and streamline three critical university operations at Mindoro State University - Bongabong Campus: Student Affairs Services (SAS), Registrar workflows, and University Student Government (USG) transparency initiatives. The system consolidates previously manual, paper-based processes into a unified digital ecosystem that reduces processing time, increases transparency, and improves service delivery to students and staff.

### Vision Statement

> Create a single, coherent digital platform that eliminates paper-based bottlenecks, reduces document processing time by 75%, and establishes MinSU Bongabong as a model of administrative efficiency and transparency in regional higher education.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points

**Student Affairs (SAS) Operations:**
- **Manual scholarship processing**: Paper applications require 2-3 weeks for approval workflows, with frequent loss of documentation
- **Fragmented organization management**: 23 student organizations (11 minor, 12 major) maintain separate, inconsistent records
- **Physical document archives**: Over 5 years of student records stored in filing cabinets, making retrieval time-consuming (average 15-20 minutes per document)
- **Insurance record tracking**: No centralized system for NSTP insurance submissions, leading to compliance gaps
- **Event coordination**: Multiple stakeholders use incompatible calendaring systems (WhatsApp, email, bulletin boards)

**Registrar Workflows:**
- **Manual document requests**: Students submit paper forms, pay in-person, and wait 5-7 days for documents (COG, TOR, COE)
- **Payment reconciliation**: Cashier records kept separately from registrar records, requiring manual cross-verification
- **No delivery tracking**: Students must physically return to collect documents; no notification system
- **High abandonment rate**: ~30% of requests are never completed due to payment friction or pickup inconvenience

**USG Transparency Requirements:**
- **Static information**: VMGO, officer lists, and resolutions published only on physical bulletin boards
- **No centralized communication**: Announcements scattered across Facebook, bulletin boards, and word-of-mouth
- **Limited accountability**: No public record of resolutions or officer activities
- **Event visibility**: Campus-wide events known only to directly involved students

### Quantified Impact

| Metric | Current State | Target State | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Document request turnaround | 5-7 days | <24 hours | 80% reduction |
| Scholarship approval time | 2-3 weeks | 3-5 days | 75% reduction |
| Document retrieval time | 15-20 minutes | <30 seconds | 97% reduction |
| Payment processing | In-person only | Digital (GCash, PayMaya, cards) | 100% accessibility increase |
| Calendar fragmentation | 5+ systems | 1 unified calendar | 100% consolidation |
| USG information accessibility | Campus only | Web-accessible 24/7 | Unlimited reach |

## Out of Scope (Explicitly Excluded)

The following features are **intentionally excluded** from Version 1.0 to maintain focus and timeline:

- **Mobile native apps** (iOS/Android): Web-responsive design sufficient for mobile access; native apps deferred to Year 2 roadmap
- **Advanced analytics dashboard**: Basic reporting only; Tableau-style analytics deferred
- **SMS-based notifications for all events**: SMS limited to critical registrar updates due to cost; email primary channel
- **Integration with LMS (Moodle/Canvas)**: Student records remain separate; no grade import from LMS
- **Alumni portal**: Focus on current students; alumni self-service deferred
- **Online enrollment system**: Document requests only; full enrollment workflow separate project
- **Financial aid disbursement**: System tracks scholarship approval but does not handle actual fund transfers (remains with Finance Office)
- **Multi-language support**: English-only for Version 1.0; Tagalog translation deferred
- **Advanced document workflow (e-signatures)**: Generated documents include digital seal but not DocuSign-style workflows
- **Third-party calendar integrations** (Google Calendar API push): iCal export only; direct integration deferred

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Payment gateway downtime** | Critical (blocks registrar revenue) | Low | Implement retry logic, webhook buffering, manual payment reconciliation fallback |
| **Staff resistance to change** | High (adoption failure) | Medium | Comprehensive training, gradual rollout, maintain paper backup for 1 semester |
| **Data migration errors** | High (data loss) | Low | Extensive testing on copies, manual verification sample, rollback plan |
| **Scholarship fraud** (fake documents) | Medium (financial loss) | Low | Document verification workflow, cross-reference with registrar records, audit trail |
| **Server downtime during peak** (enrollment periods) | High (student frustration) | Medium | Load testing, auto-scaling, status page, email fallback for critical updates |
| **Incomplete digitalization** (archive too large) | Medium (search gaps) | Medium | Prioritize recent 2 years first, phased digitalization over 18 months |
| **Payment webhook failure** | High (delayed documents) | Low | Webhook retry mechanism (3 attempts), manual payment verification dashboard |
| **Scope creep** (stakeholders request additional features) | High (timeline slip) | High | Formal change request process, defer to Version 2.0 roadmap, product owner authority |
